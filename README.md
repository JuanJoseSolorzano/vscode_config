# VS Code Settings and Keybindings

This directory contains customized settings and keybindings for Visual Studio Code. These configurations are tailored to enhance productivity and streamline the development workflow.

## Files

- **settings.json**: Contains user-specific settings for Visual Studio Code, including editor preferences, theme customizations, and language-specific configurations.
- **keybindings.json**: Defines custom keyboard shortcuts to improve navigation and accessibility within the editor.

## Usage

1. Copy the `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` files into your VS Code configuration directory.
2. Restart Visual Studio Code to apply the changes.

## Notes

- Ensure that the paths and configurations in `settings.json` are updated to match your system environment.
- Review the keybindings in `keybindings.json` to avoid conflicts with existing shortcuts.
